    "Ok, Ben Franklin never said that, but as far as often quoted misquotes go, it is of the highest\n",
    "quality. But beyond being just an enjoyable pint, beer is also big business. Forget about the\n",
    "big multinationals. According to The Brewers Association, the craft brewing industry\n",
    "contributed $79.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018, more than 550,000 jobs(1). Nationally,\n",
    "the number of craft breweries is growing, though the annual growth rate is decelerating. The\n",
    "growth rate was 21% from 2014-2015 and has fallen to 13% from 2017-2018(2).\n",
    "That being said, if you want to investigate the possibility of opening a brewery, some thing to\n",

    "This information is available from the U.S. Census Bureau via API. Within the report I will\n",
    "obtain the population for each zip code in the state. Then a limit (which can be changed) will\n",
    "be set and populations below this number will be dropped.\n",
    "Given a zip code, Nominatim will be used to retrieve a latitude and longitude associated with\n",
    "the zip code, and this lat./long. data will be used in making calls to Foursquare. Information\n",
    "returned by Foursquare will in be a list of breweries within a given radius. The count of the\n",
    "breweries and the population (and the name associated with the zip code) will be analyzed\n",
    "with the intent of finding an area with a relatively high population and a relatively low\n",
    "number of breweries already present."
